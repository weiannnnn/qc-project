This is a repository for Wei Ann's Quantum Computing Research at Tractable. It is a space for 

1. Documenting learning
2. Implementing algorithms using different Quantum SDKs
3. Creating demos for knowledge sharing sessions
4. A Python project for Quantum Machine Learning that hopefully will evolve into something wonderful!
